## Setting up dev environment

After cloning the remote repository to your local machine

1. In the directory containing 'requirements.txt', run
   'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. Download the latest version of npm to use React, run
   'npm install -g npm'  
   you can confirm it has downloaded by running  
    'npm -v'
   to see what version you are running
3. Create a .gitignore file, put it somewhere in your project directory.  
   Github has a useful gitignore for python projects:  
   https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore
